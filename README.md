# network-eda
brainstorming about tools for EDA for networks

things i want to know:

- number of components and component sizes
- edges: weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected, signed/unsigned
- multigraph vs graph
- number of isolated singletons / dyads
- (in/out degree) distribution
- first couple singular values
- rank of adjacency matrix (estimate)
- clustering coefficient (?) -- i've never looked at this much before, but maybe i should?
- network density / sparsity
- number of nodes
- network diameter
